Den bosch is one dinosaur richer, a skeleton of the kroketosaurus has been placed in den bosch. All because researchers couldn't understand the heritage of the dinosaur, they say that there was a rare fossil in the stomach of the dinosaur. When a dutch researcher saw the fossil they immedieatly knew that it was fossil of a Kroket and that was key to the missing link of the heritage. And that is why the Kroketosaurus is back where it grew up. So if your old bones get discoverd in the future make sure you have a kroket fossil in you so your body is returned to your favorite country. Take no chance, Take a Kroket!
