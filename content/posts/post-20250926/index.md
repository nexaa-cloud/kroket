Hey so I thought it would be a good idea to go international with this small idea, What if you are on a airport and your are craving for a Kroket. All store space is allready occupied so what if we deliverd Krokets with drones while you are waiting in the gate? Seems like a lot of airports aren't happy about this so now I am stuck with a big stock. So please order a Kroket today and keep the our airspace clear!
