Sinterklaas is in our country, carrying presents, doing sick tricks on our roofs with his horse. Talking about his horse, back in my time we had Amerigo the GOAT. Now we have Ozosnel. But what happend to my favorite roofsliding horse?
All we know is that Sinterklaas and Piet expect a Kroket in our shoes tonight!
