Brothers! we have experienced heresy. Kroketday is not one day a year, it is when the weekend is in front of you. To launch yourself into the weekend with great energy we devour our krokets!
A bit of history: The first National Kroket day was introduced on 9 October 2014, The #TGIKF originates from 2006.
Yes I did enjoy the Kroket on the 9th of October but why limit ourselves with only one Kroket a year. WHO WANTS MORE KROKETS?
