Morning all, yesterday it was the 50th anniversary of the movie Jaws.
Fun myth about the movie is that they had to tame the shark by shooting Korkets in the beast with a special Kroket Canon. The beast was so in love with krokets that he actually didn't like human flesh anymore but the acting skills of the shark were amazing. Should've recieved an oscar for it. So lets pretend to be jaws today and bite in some delicious krokets.
