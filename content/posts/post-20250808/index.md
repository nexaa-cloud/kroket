Hello All, Be aware there is a problem in the Netherlands, and it is called a Wolf. In Utrecht you are not safe this vicious creature bites children, is eating the cats, is eating the dogs. So don't go near the forest in Utrecht. Unless you visit the forest on Fridays. The wolf has been showing a pattern that every friday it walks to the nearest Febo to get a Kroket and that gives him enough energy for the rest of the day. Like we already knew and if wolfs are doing it why don't you!
