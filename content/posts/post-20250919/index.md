Ahoy hungry hearties! Set yer sights on the golden treasure o’ the galley – KROKET! Crispy on the outside, molten bounty within. Perfect grub fer a stormy day at sea or a quick bite afore plunderin’. 
“All hands on deck! Load the buns! Fetch the mustard! Guard the kroket like ye would yer rum!”
Rumour says whoever eats the last kroket walks the plank… or does the dishes.
