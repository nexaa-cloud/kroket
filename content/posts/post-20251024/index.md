This week some important juwels got stolen from the Louvre. Important historical objects have been stolen by a bunch of construction workers that enter the building with a cargo elevator. Everyone thinks that the motive is the juwels but little do people know that the historical royal Kroket was also stored there. Those construction workers were just very hungry and needed a bite.
So treat yourself with a royal snack!
