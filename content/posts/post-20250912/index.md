It is a sad day for the snack society on the road and the hidden heroes of our society, truckerscaf√© Kanters in Moerdijk is closed. Where do all these package deliverers need to get there energy booster on fridays?!
Will my package arive on time? will my box of Krokets arrive at my place? or will the package be switch with a Bamischijf!? I need answers, politician need to restore this vital place and give back to our Kroket friends.
As support we need more Krokets, we need to stress the delivery chain so the government will feel the pain of the closure of this small but important place.
