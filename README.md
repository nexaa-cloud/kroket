# Getting started

- Clone the repository
- run `make serve`

## Create a new kroket post

Run `name="my-title" make new-post` to initialize a new post with the title "My title".
This will create a new directory in `content/posts/my-title/` with an `index.md` file for your post content. 
If you want to add an image you should add the image in the same folder as the post.

The image should be placed in the same directory as the `index.md` file.

Push your changes to the `main` branch to publish the post.
